# fract-ol

fract-ol is a small fractal exploration program written in C that utilizes the MLX42 graphics library. The program allows users to generate and explore two types of fractals: the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set. Fractals are complex and infinitely detailed mathematical patterns that exhibit self-similarity at various scales.
